This is a project that combines social, psychological and informational help for people who have came to Germany permanently, especially refugees. In this work I tried to combine Web-Development and VideoArt, thus trying to increase the visual impact on the user. You can read more about the project on the "About" page.
In my work I used libraries such as:
-React Hook Form,
-React-paypal-js
-React-icons 
-React-player
-React-scroll
-Use-clipboard-copy
-Yup
-Cors
-Dotenv
-Express
-Mongoose
