This is a project that combines social, psychological and informational help for people who have came to Germany permanently, especially refugees. In this work I tried to combine Web-Development and VideoArt, thus trying to increase the visual impact on the user. You can read more about the project on the "About" page.
In my work I used libraries such as:
<ul>
<li>React Hook Form</li>
<li>React-paypal-js</li>
<li>React-icons </li>
<li>React-player</li>
<li>React-scroll</li>
<li>Use-clipboard-copy</li>
<li>Yup</li>
<li>Cors</li>
<li>Dotenv</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>Mongoose</li>
</ul>
